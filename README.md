# ECSTownBuilder

[PLAY WEB](https://waterneverstops.itch.io/ecs-town-builder)

City builder game made with [EcsLite](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecslite).

The gameplay from Pharaoh is taken as a basis. It has most base mechanics of its city builder part except house merging.

Road access and building connections evaluation is optimized using Disjoint-set data structure.

3d assets from [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/assets?q=3d)

## Things to improve:

- Packing entity with world in grid was overkill.
- Common countdown system.
- Refreshing workforce access optimization.
- Move all constants to config.
- Ghosting in destroy mode.
