# ECSTownBuilder

[PLAY](https://waterneverstops.itch.io/ecs-town-builder)

City builder game made with [EcsLite](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecslite).

The gameplay from Pharaoh is taken as a basis. It has most base mechanics of the city builder part except house merging.

## Things to improve:

- Packing entity with world in grid was overkill.
- Common countdown system.
- Refreshing workforce access optimization.
- Move all constants to config.
- Ghosting in destroy mode.
